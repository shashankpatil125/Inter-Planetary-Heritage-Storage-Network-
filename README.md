# Inter Planetary Cultural Storage (IPCS) 

## ETH HACK FS 2023 <br>


We made a Data DAO for Cultural History.  Stories of cultures, arts and people are preserved by a decentralized network using the IPCS “inter planetary cultural storage” contracts.

<li>Testnet contracts for end-users to administer the File Storage in the collection<br></li>
<li>Empowering historians with provenance and future royalties or collaborations<br></li>
<li>Ability to store large data collections like National Archives <br></li>
<br>
Used by: <br>

Historians, UNESCO, Content Creators, and Art Collections, AI and ML

Ideal for:<br>
National Libraries, Collections, Public Archives, Large Photo Libraries

Example Decentralized Science: The IPCS app can be used for cross-border decentralized science allowing historians to adopt Data DAO rules for computing with data from global heritage sites and large archives. 

  

### OUR USE CASE:

This use case includes one of the most culturally diverse places in Los Angeles, a park in East LA. Members of the Data DAO record cultural histories of communities, local arts, photos and stories of cultural diversity in significant places that must be preserved. 

### How it's Made

FILECOIN - Calibration Testnet
1. Deploy Data DAO contracts for IPCS to Calibration Testnet
2. Configure the DAO tokens, voting, and governance use case for IPCS
3. Use voting function to calculate votes and approve Filecoin  storage deals.
4. Use Lighthouse Storage SDK to store successful cultural asset files on Filecoin.Storage on Calibration Testnet.
5. Storage providers notified of new storage deals.
6. We were inspired by FIL and Protocol Labs to innovate with DataDAO technology. We built this project with FVM to enable curation, compute-over-data, and governance of valuable cultural Datasets.

IPFS - 
1. User Input cultural data to Front-end.
2. Send Metadata to IPFS using NFT.storage sdk.
3. Retrieve IPFS meta-data by providing the CID.
4. The storage is immutable and the Cultural History can be accessed anywhere. 

NFT.storage
1. Trigger nft storage from user front-end asset upload. 
2. Include custom metadata: cultural significance, location, etc
3. Use NFT.storage store method to upload metadata to IPFS.
4. We are answering the NFT.storage teams call for Social Good Warriors: Making sustainability, and preventing misinformation a part of the IPCS system.

LIGHTHOUSE Storage 
1. The CID and meta-data are passed into the Storage Deal
2. Data DAO members send storage proposals to Filecoin storage providers using Lighthouse sdk.

APECOIN
1. Require Apecoin for Voting 
2. Create custom Apecoin contract for Calibration Testnet.
3. Add Mint functionality in Front-End for users to get their first Calibration Testnet Apecoin.
4. Reward cultural preservation professionals using IPCS Application  with Apecoin.
